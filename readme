                ****    NOTES   ****
once you create a javascript component, you can refer to it in other components using JSX syntax like so:
<other_coponent>

 In React, it’s conventional to use on[Event] names for props which represent events and handle[Event] for 
 the methods which handle the events.

Immutability is important because you may need to keep track of previous states or undo/redo previous actions.
Can  also detect changes easily (because if the current object is different than the previous one then theres a change)
which also allows React to know when to re-render components.

Keys help React keep track of list items. Each list item should have a unique key that is not an index (in most cases).
Lists, like other components, will need to be re-rendered when there is a change. In this case, if the current list
has a list-item key that is not in the previous list, then the list will be re-rendered. 


                ****    GLOSSARY    ****
three things that are useful for react projects:
nvm - (Node Version Manager) - provides a way to switch between NodeJS versions when necessary

Node.js - Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. (a runtime here refers
to where the JavaScript is executed. in this case it is v8.) So this will provide us a place to execute our js. 

npm - (Node Package Manager) is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language. Similar to Pip

React - JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Build complex UIs from small isolated pieces
        of code called "components"

component - tells React what we want to display on the screen. When data changes, React re-renders components.
        Takes parameteres called "props" and a hiearchy of views to display via the render() method. you can use 
        these components in other components

react element - what is returned by the render() method of a component.

jsx - special syntax used for describing react elements. Javascript can run anywhere within these elements.

props - parameters for a component

state - set of variables that should be kept private to components. Keeps track of private variables basically.
Devtools can allow you to see the state of instances of react components.

lifting state up - when the state of each child component is stored in the parent component instead. This is 
cleaner than storing the state in each child component.

Document Object Model (DOM)- DOM, a World Wide Web Consortium standard logical representation of any webpage. 
In easier words, DOM is a tree-like structure that contains all the elements and it’s properties of a website 
as its nodes.

controlled components: components that are controlled by the state of a parent component. EX. Square.

function components: components which only contain the render() method and don't have their own state.

key: something that every react element has. 




                ****    USEFUL COMMANDS     ****

nvm commands:
nvm ls (check versions of node.js installed)
nvm install node (install latest unstable version of node.js)
nvm install --lts (install stable long-term support version of node.js)
nvm use --lts (change to Long Term Support version of node.js)

npm commands:
npm install react (install react framework)
npm start (start react app)
npm
